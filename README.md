## Tableau Visualizations of West Nile Virus Project
Background: In my Data Science Intensive Program we had a group project in which we had to give a presentation on the West Nile Virus in Chicago data that we were given and make a model to predict when and where the next outbreak of the virus would take place.  I took the lead on creating visualizations and explaining the data.
